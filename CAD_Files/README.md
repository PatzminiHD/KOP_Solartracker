# CAD Files

This directory contains all CAD Files.

Unfortunately because of us having to use CREO we cannot put the files in Subdirectories (CREO would not find the files used in an assembly once you close and reopen them).

All Files starting with `999999_` are part of the 220916_arduuno.asm assembly.
All files starting with `999998_` are part of the 230114_pcb.asm assembly.
