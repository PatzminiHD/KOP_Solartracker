# Solartracker

Here we design the idea for one of our school projects, a solartracker.

### Given Requirements:
- It should have 2 axes to follow the position of the sun
- Design a mechanical concept to turn and tilt a solar cell and make a 3D CAD Model of the concept
- The tracker should be controlled by an Arduino
- Document the Code in a program flow chart

### Provided Materials:
- 1x [Solarcell](https://www.conrad.at/de/p/sol-expert-sm2380-sm2380-solarmodul-190469.html "Link")
- 2x [Servo](https://www.conrad.at/de/p/reely-midi-servo-analog-servo-getriebe-material-plastik-stecksystem-jr-2144550.html?searchType=SearchRedirect "Link")
- 4x [Light Depending Resistor](https://www.conrad.at/de/p/luna-optoelectronics-pdv-p8103-fotowiderstand-ldr-tht-1-st-150-v-max-l-x-b-x-h-4-29-x-5-08-x-2-mm-1762910.html?searchType=SearchRedirect "Link")
